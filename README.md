# spotifyR

Spotify have gained popularity for their music streaming service since they were launched in 2008. They stream assorted genre of songs, such as Hip-hop, Dance, Latin, etc. In this project, I built a model to classify songs from different genres. Songs were selected based on being on the top billboard charts in the last 11 years, compiling a list of 3544 songs in the five genres; 950 country, 868 dance, 751 latin, 883 R&B/HipHop, and 92 rock songs. I chose to use year end charts to avoid having the same song in the dataset multiple times. The data was gathered using a Python script, with packages beautifulsoup and pandas, to read the billboard.com year-end chart pages and store the title and artist information. The script then used the title and artist to obtain the URI for Spotify. Once the script finished running, the data was output to a CSV file to be read by R. Once in R, the spotifyr package was used to collect the features about each song.
